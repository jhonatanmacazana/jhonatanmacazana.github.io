I'm a Peruvian-based Full stack developer for over 3 years. I'm interested in the [JAM Stack][p1], with plenty of experience in **React** and **Next.js** work. Also, I'm a big fan of tRPC, along with GraphQL and [other tools][p2] that work really nicely with Typescript.

<br />

I have a bachelor's degree in electrical engineering with a specialization in Digital and Computational Systems, with a special interest in IoT devices with low power consumption and the entire ecosystem for the development of a specific application.

<br />

I have developed my own web cloud to monitor remote LoRa-based stations. Lately, I have realized worked with the open-source platform [Thingsboard][p2]. I have worked on several projects related to environmental parameter acquisition with IoT. Published one indexed paper in IEEE related to temperature acquisition inside buildings.

<br />

I have also a good understanding of the cloud by constantly trying up new technologies. I
have managed several production environments with Docker containers, orchestrators, and
load balancers. Worked as Software architect of three Peruvian startups:

- [Nextmedicall][e1]
- [Linkop][e2]
- [Certificatek][e3]
