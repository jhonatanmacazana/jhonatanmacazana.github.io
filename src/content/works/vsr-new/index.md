This is a cli tool for creating a specific type of project with a name. `vsr-new` can fetch the desired structure from another repo and create a new directory structure with the starting files for the specified project. The binaries compiled from Rust are working on Windows64, MacOS, and Linux.

I built `vsr-new` with Rust for learning more of the language and have a new tool available. It uses recursion and async requests to the Github API.

The releases are in github and can be use with node as a one time execution app.
