This is an air quality measurement device for CO, CO2, PM of 2.5um, and PM of 10um. The project has a simple interface with the user with an RGB Ld, a 16x2 LCD screen and a push button. This device is portable and was used to perform an study on many points of interests on Lima, Peru. 

During the design phase, I developed the firmware of the sensors, and the human interface.
